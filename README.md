## Questions ##

- Send email for *personal matters only*.
- If you want to post a piece of source code, please DO NOT upload an image of it. Because it is hard to reconstruct texts from images.
    + Instead, use GitHub Markdown's ["fenced code blocks" feature](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks).
    + Or, you can always use [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

# Assignments & Projects #

- There will be 1 assignments, and 4 iterations of projects.

## Honor Code ##

- Do not copy other's source code, including other students' and resources around the Web. 
- *DO NOT CHEAT*. If you copy other's source code, you will get F. Note that we have a good automatic clone detector.

## Submission ##

- Basically, due will be the Sunday 23:59. I will specify due date of each assignments and iterations on its instructions.
- You can still submit until the next to the next Sunday 23:59, but you will get only 70% of the score.
- For assignments, TBA.
- For project iterations, we will use Github.

## Github ##

This is a step-by-step instruction.
- Register at [GitHub](https://github.com).
- Give your information to me [here](https://goo.gl/Sx0CtL).
- Then I will include you to *snu-sf-class* organization.
- Create a *PRIVATE* repository inside *snu-sf-class* organization.
- Then I will automatically crawl your repositories at deadline.
